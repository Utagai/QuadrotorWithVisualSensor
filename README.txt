This is a quadrotor model for use in Gazebo, which is heavily adopted from the default quadrotor model from Gazebo's model library.

This model modifies the original sdf to include a visual sensor camera, which is fully functional. Use Topic Visualization to find the visual sensor link under the quadrotor to grab the feed. On Gazebo 
5.0+ you should see a projection of the feed in the simulation itself.

Credit for non-visual-sensor code goes to the original authors of the Gazebo model library, specificlaly of the "quadrotor" model.
